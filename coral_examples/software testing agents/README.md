# Software Testing Agents with LangChain

This example demonstrates a multi-agent software testing system built using LangChain and the Coral Protocol. Agents collaborate to fetch, analyze, and test pull requests (PRs) against existing unit tests in any compatible GitHub repository.

Compared to the earlier version, this implementation is more general: it supports running tests on PRs from much various repositories. For example, you can use it to test PRs from your own forked repositories such as [https://github.com/renxinxing123/camel-software-testing](https://github.com/renxinxing123/camel-software-testing). The system is designed as a minimal but extensible prototype, and it can be adapted to handle more complex codebases.

## Overview of Agents

The system consists of four cooperating agents, each with a specific responsibility:

* **Interface Agent**
  Accepts user instructions, manages the workflow, and coordinates other agents.

* **GitCloneAgent**
  Clones the GitHub repository and checks out the specific pull request branch.
  → Uses the `checkout_github_pr` tool to clone the repo and check out the PR branch using `git` commands.

* **CodeDiffReviewAgent**
  Analyzes the PR diff, identifies the changed function, maps it to the corresponding test function, and locates the test file path.
  → Uses the `get_pr_code_changes` tool built on top of the GitHub API via `PyGithub` to fetch the code diffs of the PR.

* **UnitTestRunnerAgent**
  Runs the specified unit test using `pytest` and returns structured test results.
  → Uses three tools:

  * `list_project_files` to enumerate all project files,
  * `read_project_files` to read test source code,
  * `run_test` to execute the selected test with `pytest` and capture structured output.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, clone the [Coral MCP server](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-server):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-server.git
```

Make sure you have:

* Python 3.9 or above
* A valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` exported in your environment
* A valid `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` exported in your environment

---

## Running the Example

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install langchain-mcp-adapters langchain-openai worldnewsapi langchain langchain-core PyGithub
```

---

### 2. Start the MCP Server

Navigate to the `coral-server` directory and run:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

Note: Gradle may appear to stall at 83%, but the server is running. Check terminal logs to confirm.

---

### 3. Launch Agents (in four separate terminals)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Interface Agent
python 0-langchain-interface.py
```

```bash
# Terminal 2: GitClone Agent
python 1-langchain-GitCloneAgent.py
```

```bash
# Terminal 3: CodeDiffReview Agent
python 2-langchain-CodeDiffReviewAgent.py
```

```bash
# Terminal 4: UnitTestRunner Agent
python 3-langchain-UnitTestRunnerAgent.py
```

---

### 4. Interact with the System

Once all agents are running, interact with the Interface Agent via standard input.

Example instructions:

```

Please execute the unit test for the '6' PR in repo 'renxinxing123/software-testing-code'.

```

In this example, since multiple files were modified, the Software Testing Agents identified all relevant unit test file and executed the full set of unit tests defined in this files.

```

Please execute the unit test for the '7' PR in repo 'renxinxing123/software-testing-code'.

```

Here, although only a subset of files were changed, the system still ran **all test cases in each matched test file**. It no longer attempts to identify and run individual unit test functions, but instead executes full file for more reliable coverage and simpler logic.

```

Please execute the unit test for the '1' PR in repo 'renxinxing123/camel-software-testing'.

```

```

Please execute the unit test for the '2' PR in repo 'renxinxing123/camel-software-testing'.

```

These two demonstrates that the agents can also handle PRs from other compatible repositories. The system will analyze the diffs, locate the relevant unit test file, and run all unit tests found in it.
